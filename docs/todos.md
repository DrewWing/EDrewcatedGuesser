#### Priorities During November
1. Fixing Critical Bugs
2. Adding Critical Features
3. Documentation
   1. Project Setup
   2. Running the Project
   3. Training a New Algorithm (if implemented)
4. Licensing

### December 2024

#### Priorities During December
1. Licensing
2. Documentation
   1. Project Setup
   2. Running the Project
   3. Training a New Algorithm (if implemented)
3. Minor bugfixing
4. polish

**December 1st:** Hard deadline for new features. Any feature not functional is put on pause until post-release updates.
**December 18th:** Train algorithm for current season. \
**December 19th:** Soft deadline of no more commits. Upload project to GitHub and start setting up issue templates, etc. \
**December 22nd:** Hard deadline of no commits (except to fix critical bugs). Attempt a fresh install, setup, and run. \
**December 24th:** Hard deadline of release.

## To-Do Items

### Bugs
  - [X] ~~`[Critical]` `[Git]` `[External]` Fix the gitignore in all branches to ignore .venv/ folder. Otherwise, VS Code says too many changes and won't show the git changes for any other branch.~~
  - [ ] `[Powershell]` `[FTC API]` `[REST]` All teams in opr/all-teams are invalid API request messagees, due to the team # being put in as the event code.
    - [ ] Figure out where in the world these files keep coming from! (unused)
  - [ ] `[OPR]` `[Accuracy]` Weird bug with some teams' recent OPR calculated as 0 for lower amounts of days (30)
    - Probably due to the team not playing matches within the last 30 days - fix and just replace with their respective all-time OPRs insted (requires re-training of machine learning algorithms)
  - [ ] `[Tests]` `[Argparse]` Import tests fail due to argparse.

### Docs
  - [ ] `[Critical]` `[Readme]` Add instructions to creating secrets.txt to the readme (authorizationheader needs to be no spaces or quotes)

  - [ ] `[Critical]` `[ReadMe]` Add documentation about `venvSetup.ps1` script.
  - [X] ~~`[Docs]` Reorganize this `todos.md` page and sort by category.~~


### Tests
  - [ ] `[Code]` `[Tests]` Create script to update test pass/fail status in the `README.md` file.
  - [ ] `[Code]` `[Tests]` Add tests
    - [X] ~~Correct files in correct places~~
    - [ ] Machine learning is recent to the correct season  year
    - [ ] Conventions
      - [ ] Proper header for all scripts
        - [X] ~~Python~~
        - [ ] Powershell
        - [ ] BASH

    - prepare-machinelearningpy training_data_matches
  - [ ] `[Speed]` Maybe add GPU/NPU support?
    - [ ] `[Code]` Switch to Pytorch?


### Other
  - [ ] `[Code]` Make Google Sheets pushing optional, and add option for local spreadsheet
