This is the `todos.md` file. For more information, please read the [Readme](README.md).

Items labeled `Critical` need to be fixed/completed before the next release, and should be listed before non-critical items.

## Upcoming Timeline
<!-- ### November 2024
Finish features for release, flesh out docs, possibly get ML algorithm training bugfree.

#### Priorities During November
1. Fixing Critical Bugs
2. Adding Critical Features
3. Documentation
   1. Project Setup
   2. Running the Project
   3. Training a New Algorithm (if implemented)
4. Licensing -->

<!-- ### December 2024

#### Priorities
1. Licensing
2. Documentation
   1. Project Setup
   2. Running the Project
   3. ~~Training a New Algorithm~~ (did not meet feature deadline, pushed back to post-release)
3. Minor bugfixing
4. polish

#### Deadlines
**December 1st:** Hard deadline for new features. Any feature not functional is put on pause until post-release updates.

**December 18th:** Train algorithm for current season.

**December 19th:** Soft deadline of no more commits. Upload project to GitHub and start setting up issue templates, etc.

**December 22nd:** Hard deadline of no commits (except to fix critical bugs). Attempt a fresh install, setup, and run.

**December 24th:** Hard deadline of release. -->


### Release items

2. Make algorithm training usable
3. Fix bugs


## To-Do Items

### GitHub

### Bugs
  - [ ] `[PowerShell]` `[FTC API]` `[REST]` All teams in opr/all-teams are invalid API request messagees, due to the team # being put in as the event code.

  - [ ] `[OPR]` `[Accuracy]` Weird bug with some teams' recent OPR calculated as 0 for lower amounts of days (30)
    - Probably due to the team not playing matches within the last 30 days - fix and just replace with their respective all-time OPRs insted (requires re-training of machine learning algorithms)
  - [ ] `[Tests]` `[Argparse]` Import tests fail due to argparse.
  - [ ] `[Sheets]` Implement version checking in Google Sheet (make sure sheet template is compatible with current software version)



### Tests
  - [ ] `[Code]` `[Tests]` Create script to update test pass/fail status in the `README.md` file.
  - [ ] `[Code]` `[Tests]` Add tests
    - [ ] Machine learning is recent to the correct season  year
    - [ ] Conventions
      - [ ] Proper header for all scripts
        - [X] ~~Python~~
        - [ ] Powershell
        - [ ] BASH

    - [ ] ~~line_counter.py~~
    - [ ] ~~view_data.py?~~
  - [ ] `[Files]` Rename scripts to match their function better and update all references to those scripts.


### Optimizations
  - [ ] `[Speed]` Convert more things to use numpy matrices instead of pandas dataframes (much faster)
    - prepare-machinelearningpy training_data_matches
  - [ ] `[Speed]` Maybe add GPU/NPU support?
    - [ ] `[Code]` Switch to Pytorch?


### Other
  - [ ] `[Code]` Make Google Sheets pushing optional, and add option for local spreadsheet
  - [ ] `[Code]` Add markdown support for line  counter
  - [ ] `[Code]` Convert all Python scripts to be completely object-oriented, make master Python script replacing PowerShell/BASH scripts.
  - [ ] `[Code]` Add feature of ftcapi.ps1 to detect if .venv was selected but no .venv exists, and asks the user whether they would like the script to automatically create the venv for them using the venv creation script.
