Documentation on how statistics (OPR, AutoOPR, CCWM, etc.) calculation works, so I'm not forced
to reverse-engineer my old code every time I make changes.

## Files and Directories
Each season's data is separated into separate directories by season year (ex: `generatedfiles/2024`, `generatedfiles/2023`, etc.). \
The `eventdata` folder contains only <u>raw</u> data from the FIRST API.
  - `event_matches.json`, `event_rankings.json`, `eventschedule_qual.json`, `eventschedule_playoff.json`, and `event_teams.json` are all queries of the CURRENT event with code `EVENT_CODE`.
  - `event_rankings.csv` is a processed file, but no data is really changed. It's just the .csv version of `event_rankings.json`, created by the `rankings_dataframe` func (in `json_parse`) called by the `push_rankings` func in `sheets_api`.


Now, for the interesting stuff:
`team_list_filtered.csv` 


Places that OPR results are stored:
`opr_result_sorted.csv` - Season-long data for the teams in the event. \
`opr_global_result_sorted.csv` - Season-long, all-teams data. No restrictions, all events used. \
`opr_recent_result_sorted.csv` - Recent (last 30 days) stats for teams in current event. \
`opr_event_result_sorted.csv` - Event-only matches



## Stats Calculation Terms:
The following table describes the types of statistics we can calculate. Each type calculates OPR, AutoOPR, and CCWM for their given filters, and is fed into the ML algorithm for accurate match outcome prediction.
| Name | Date Range | Teams | Output file |
|------|------------|-------|-------------|
| UniversalSeasonStats | All-Season | **All** active teams in the world. **No** restrictions. | `opr_global_result_sorted.csv` |
| RegularSeasonStats   | All-Season | Only teams in current event. | `opr_result_sorted.csv` |
| RecentStats          | The last `NUMBER_OF_DAYS_FOR_RECENT_OPR` (default 30) days | Only teams in current event. | `opr_recent_result_sorted.csv` |
| EventStats           | Current event only. | Only teams in current event. | `opr_event_result_sorted.csv` |

## Process
(TODO) put text here describing the process of calculating statistics. Perhaps add a diagram.
