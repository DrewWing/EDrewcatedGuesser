Documentation on how statistics (OPR, AutoOPR, CCWM, etc.) calculation works, so I'm not forced
to reverse-engineer my old code every time I make changes.

## Files and Directories
Each season's data is separated into separate directories by season year (ex: `generatedfiles/2024`, `generatedfiles/2023`, etc.).
It's assumed in the rest of this document that all files and directories are within the current season year directory.

### Eventdata
The `eventdata` folder contains only <u>raw</u> data from the FIRST API.
  - `event_matches.json`, `event_rankings.json`, `eventschedule_qual.json`, `eventschedule_playoff.json`, and `event_teams.json` are all queries of the CURRENT event with code `EVENT_CODE`.
  - `event_rankings.csv` is a processed file, but no data is really changed. It's just the .csv version of `event_rankings.json`, created by the `rankings_dataframe` func (in `json_parse`) called by the `push_rankings` func in `sheets_api`.

<br>

### Team List Filtered
The file `team_list_filtered.csv` file is <u>generated</u> by the `prepare_opr_calculation` function in `json_parse.py`.
The content of this file is simply the team numbers of all unique teams in the matches filtered by the function.

<br>

### Results
Places that OPR results are stored:
`opr_result_sorted.csv` - Season-long data for the teams in the event. \
`opr_global_result_sorted.csv` - Season-long, all-teams data. No restrictions, all events used. \
`opr_recent_result_sorted.csv` - Recent (last 30 days) stats for teams in current event. \
`opr_event_result_sorted.csv` - Event-only matches


## Stats Calculation Terms:
The following table describes the types of statistics we can calculate. Each type calculates OPR, AutoOPR, and CCWM for their given filters, and is fed into the ML algorithm for accurate match outcome prediction.
| Name                 | Date Range                                                 | Teams                                                   | Output file |
| :------------------  | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ | :---------- |
| UniversalSeasonStats | All-Season                                                 | **All** active teams in the world*. **No** restrictions. | `opr_global_result_sorted.csv` |
| RegularSeasonStats   | All-Season                                                 | Only teams in current event.                            | `opr_result_sorted.csv` |
| RecentStats          | The last `NUMBER_OF_DAYS_FOR_RECENT_OPR` (default 30) days | Only teams in current event.                            | `opr_recent_result_sorted.csv` |
| EventStats           | Current event only.                                        | Only teams in current event.                            | `opr_event_result_sorted.csv` |

*Note that stats calculation will **only** use the events stored in `opr/all_events` (created by `__main__.py`). 
If events are missing from there, they will **not** be accounted for.

## Stats Calculation Mode
The environment variable `CALCULATION_MODE` may be set to any of the following, which changes <u>when</u> calculations are run:

> [!Note]
> If `DO_JOBLIB_MEMORY` is `True` (default), all calculations are cached. Calculations are not re-run unless input data is changed.

### AUTO
Automatic mode (default, recommended).
 - **UniversalSeasonStats**
   - If any team being calculated doesn't already have global calculations, OR
   - If the last time UniversalSeasonStats calc was run is **>30 days** ago.
 - **RegularSeasonStats**
   - If any team being calculated doesn't already have RegularSeasonStats stats, OR
   - If **>=1 hours** passed since last calc, OR
   - If RegularSeasonStats has never been run.
 - **RecentStats**
   - Runs every cycle.
 - **EventStats**
   - Runs every cycle.


### AUTO_CONSERVATIVE
Automatic conservative mode, same as AUTO except

 - **UniversalSeasonStats**
   - <u>Only</u> if any team being calculated doesn't already have global calculations.
 - **RegularSeasonStats** 
   - If any team being calculated doesn't already have RegularSeasonStats stats, OR
   - If RegularSeasonStats has never been run.

### LOCAL
Local mode, disables global (season-wide) calculations and only runs calcs on the currently running event.
 - **EventStats**
   - Runs every cycle.
 - **All others**
   - Never runs.

### GLOBAL
Global mode, only runs global (all-season) calcs and disables local (current event) calcs.
 - **UniversalSeasonStats**
   - Runs every cycle.
 - **RegularSeasonStat**
   - If 1 or more days since last RegularSeasonStat calculation.
 - **All others**
   - Never runs.


### ALL
All mode, runs **every** type of calculation <u>every cycle</u>.

Some tips for performance and accuracy:
 - Don't forget to set the `EVENT_CODE` environment variable to the correct code! <!-- TODO: add documentation for this, and a link to that doc here -->
 - Run the program in `GLOBAL` mode a day or two before the event starts. This ensures that UniversalSeasonStats (which takes a while to calculate) aren't run during the event.
 - If it is very early in the season (the first 3 or so events), it may be better to run in `ALL` mode. This forces all calculation types to run, but isn't as big of a deal 
 because there's much less data to crunch.
 - Run in `AUTO_CONSERVATIVE` mode if you're dealing with performance issues.

## Process
The process for calculating stats (once every cycle) is as follows:

1. `__main__.py` calls `master_function` in `OPR.py`.
2. `master_function`:
   1. Cache heavy functions (`calculate_opr`, `build_m`, `build_scores`, and `create_and_sort_stats`).
   2. Calculate the time since global calculations were last run.
   3. For each type of calculation (UniversalSeasonStats, RegularSeasonStats, RecentStats, EventStats):
      1. Check the conditions to run the calculation type. If fail, skip to next calculation type.
      2. Call `json_parse.prepare_opr_calculation` with appropriate arguments to filter teams and matches (based on calculation type)
         1. Load all events in opr/all_events (raw FIRST API data), unless specific_event != None.
         2. Gather all matches from all loaded events.
         3. Filter matches by teams.
         4. Organize dictionary of matches per team.
         5. Save all teams involved in matches to `team_list_filtered.csv`.
         6. Save all matches to `all_matches.csv`.
      3. Load teams from `loadTeamNumbers` function (list of team numbers from `team_list_filtered.csv`).
      4. Load matches using `loadMatches` function (Pandas object from `all_matches.csv`).
      5. Calculate and save statistics to appropriate file using `do_all_opr_stuff` function.
            > [!Note]
            > The matrices form the pattern `Mx = s`, with `M` being the sparse matrix of team participation,
            `x` being the statistics (`OPR`), and `s` being the scores[^1].
         1. Build the `M` matrix using the `build_m` function (sparse matrix of ones and zeroes).
         2. Build the scores (`s`) matrices using the `build_scores` function.
         3. Calculate the statistics (`OPR`, `AUTOOPR`, `CCWM`, aka `x` in the equation) using the `calculate_opr` function.
            1. For each statistics type, use the numpy's linear algebra library to solve the least squares solution.
         4. If any statistics are of size `0`, replace the stats with a matrix of zeroes of the appropriate size.
         5. Round statistics matrices to 14 places.
         6. Combine and sort the statistics into one pandas dataframe using the function `create_and_sort_stats`.
         7. Save the aggregated statistics to the correct .csv file.
      6. If applicable, save the current timestamp to a file.
