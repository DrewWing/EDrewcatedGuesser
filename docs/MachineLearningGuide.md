# Guide to Machine Learning in this Project

> Note: The current stable version of EDrewcated Guesser does not officially support retraining ML algorithms. This is a feature planned for a future update. If you'd like to contribute, the development branch for these features is `dev-algorithm-training`. </p>


The machine learning algorithm is just fine on its own, and you should not retrain it unless you know what you are doing.

>  Note: Retraining the algorithm takes a *lot* of CPU resources and time. You have been warned.

If you *are* retraining the algorithm, follow these steps.
1. Run `update-dataset-global.sh` to gather the data (uses `opr/all-events`).
2. Run `prepare-machinelearning.py` to process the data (creates `machinefile.csv`).
3. Actually train the algorithm by running the `ml-test.py` program (uses `machinefile.csv`).
