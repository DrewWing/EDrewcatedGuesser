EDrewcated Guesser Contribution Guide


As I am still pretty new at authoring an open-source project, I may be missing some things here.

If you find a bug, have gone through documentation and the FAQs, and have not found it in the GitHub Issues or todos.md file, please submit a bug report in GitHub using the template.

If you'd like to contribute, feel free to make a fork of the project and open a PR when you're ready. I may be busy with school, so only ping me if it's been at least a week and I haven't responded.

Please see the docs/Conventions.md file for the style guide and more information on contributing.

I am planning on adding a PR template soon.
