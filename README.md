# FTCAPI V48.0 (Alpha)
## by Drew Wingfield

DO NOT DISTRIBUTE!
You may **not** earn money or monetize in any way from this program. It's not just my terms, it's also a part of the terms of using the official FTC API.

**NOTE** that this is an alpha version still in "stealth," so please ignore any references to licenses, in code or on any documentation, except this paragraph. I'll get all that ironed out before I release this.  \
Everything that I'm doing right now is unpublished, so you **may not** use it under any of these unpublished licenses. \
I'm doing my best, just use whatever version is most current under its own license. It has many bugs and is not worth it.

You can find the license [here](LICENSE.txt).
The todo list is [here](docs/todos.md)
Also see the [Updates](docs/Updates.md) page.

## Credits/Honorable Mentions
Though I wrote almost the entirety of the project by myself, I had some help. Below are some resources that I used (whether for copypasting code, general reference, or other research).

This program uses the official FIRST API to get information on matches, schedules, and scores.

The diagram `FTCAPI file diagram.drawio` (soon to be exported into an image and put in this doc) was generated using [Drawio](https://app.diagrams.net/) [24.7.7], made by JGraph, https://github.com/jgraph/drawio. \
I am not JGraph, this project is not by JGraph, and JGraph neither endorses me nor this project.

## More documentation goes here!
As always, this is a work in progress and has some bugs. Errors should be both printed to the terminal and appended to `app/generatedfiles/error.log` with a timestamp.

Good luck debugging!
