# To-Dos
This is the `todos.md` file. For more information, please read the [Readme](README.md).

Items labeled `Critical` need to be fixed/completed before release.

### Bugs
  - [ ] `[Powershell]` `[FTC API]` `[REST]` All teams in opr/all-teams are invalid API request messagees, due to the team # being put in as the event code.
    - [ ] Figure out where in the world these files keep coming from! (unused)
  - [ ] `[Speed]` Maybe add GPU/NPU support?
    - [ ] `[Code]` Switch to Pytorch?
  - [ ] `[OPR]` `[Accuracy]` Weird bug with some teams' recent OPR calculated as 0 for lower amounts of days (30)
    - Probably due to the team not playing matches within the last 30 days - fix and just replace with their respective all-time OPRs insted (requires re-training of machine learning algorithms)
  - [ ] `[Tests]` `[Argparse]` Import tests fail due to argparse.
  - [X] ~~`[Critical]` `[Git]` `[External]` Fix the gitignore in all branches to ignore .venv/ folder. Otherwise, VS Code says too many changes and won't show the git changes for any other branch.~~

### Licensing and Attribution 
Note that all tasks should be tagged `[license]` and `[critical]`.
  - [ ] `[License]` `[Critical]` Update all files to include a reference to the license and this file
    - [ ] Scripts in `app` folder
    - [ ] `tests` folder
    - [ ] `__init__.py`
  
  - [ ] `[License]` `[Critical]` Make sure licensing is correct for all packages used.
    - [ ] Update the `requirements.txt` to use only needed packages.
    - [ ] Here is the output of `pipdeptree -fl`. Thanks whoever you are for the package, it really helps!
